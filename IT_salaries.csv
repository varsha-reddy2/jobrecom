THE F5 CODE: WE EMPOWER YOU TO DO GREAT THINGS
Code is at the heart of our DNA; its what makes us human. And its at the core of our company DNA: it informs our code of ethics, guides how we work together and help our communities thrive, and drives how our product development teams innovate.
Code also brings applications to life—applications that change the world. You use these apps every day—and not just on your smartphone. Imagine life without online shopping, cloud storage, or other web-based services that we currently take for granted. F5 creates products and services that the world’s leading retailers, banks, securities firms, telecom operators, insurance companies, automotive manufacturers, and 48 of the Fortune 50 rely on to deliver their services faster and with the highest levels of flexibility, security, performance, and support.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become part of a company that’s on the leading edge of transformation. We believe code—our human code and our digital code—opens doors. And because we know that a more diverse F5 is a more powerful F5, we’re looking for smart, talented, determined individuals to join us. If you make thoughtful decisions quickly, obsess over your customers’ needs, take ownership of your work (the mistakes as well as the successes), and embrace different perspectives by putting the human first, then we want to talk to you.

Corporate Profile:

Veritas enables organizations to harness the power of their information, with solutions designed to serve the world's largest and most complex heterogeneous environments. Get industry-leading solutions that cover all platforms with backup and recovery, business continuity, software-defined storage, and information governance.

Business Overview:

Veritas Technologies enables organizations to harness their information, bolstering business success in even the most complex environments. We serve organizations of all sizes, including 86 percent of global Fortune 500 companies. In fact, for over a decade, Veritas has been recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for both Enterprise Backup Software and Integrated Appliances and Enterprise Information Archiving. Together with our experienced partner community, we help our customers improve their data availability and unlock insights to make them more competitive. With over 7,800 employees in 58 countries around the world, Veritas is a $2.5 billion company that partners with the largest technology leaders, including Amazon, Cisco, Fujitsu, Google, Hitachi, HP, IBM, Microsoft, NetApp, OpenStack, Symantec, and many more. From traditional data centers to private, public, and hybrid clouds, Veritas, together with our partner community helps enterprises€”regardless of their environment€”protect, identify, and manage data using intelligent information management solutions.

Unlock the power of information. Our software and hardware products enable companies to protect, identify, and manage data within the world's largest and most complex environments-from traditional data centers to private, public, and hybrid clouds. Veritas helps enterprises address information management challenges with a complete, organized product strategy and roadmap focused on their needs. Our backup and recovery, business continuity, software-defined storage, and information governance products help keep businesses up and running so they can focus on what they do best. The need for Veritas has never been greater. Unchecked data growth is an expensive burden-and a potential security risk.

With a majority of the world's enterprise data holding no legal, regulatory, or business value, the cost in time, money, and resources to store and manage it is staggering. But how do companies separate the valuable from the volume? Veritas solutions help them identify the needles of high-value information buried deep inside every corporate data haystack. Our approach to helping companies defy the data deluge is governed by three beliefs:
€¢ Not all data is created equal.
€¢ Infrastructure availability does not equal business uptime.
€¢ Know what data you have, keep only the data you need.

The majority of target-rich data, housed in general IT systems and metadata, is information that Veritas already touches with our backup, archive, and storage management solutions. We're uniquely positioned to bring these together to provide companies with access to information that drives informed decision-making.

Then, in July of 2020, after only 17 months as a private company, we returned to the NY Stock Exchange with an IPO that raised about $1.7 billion of new capital for our company. This has allowed us to keep investing in our company and bring new solutions to the market to meet the needs of our clients.
We have made several strategic acquisitions including, most recently Bisnode, a leading European data and analytics firm in January 2021. This acquisition positions Dun & Bradstreet to rapidly expand across the Nordics, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Central and Eastern European region.
Overall, Dun & Bradstreet is a strong company with a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We are focused on areas that will allow us to achieve growth, both organically and inorganically, to meet new demands. This includes:
Transforming our technology to scale for growth
Delivering more to our clients digitally
Fueling new products by expanding our data and analytics capabilities
Continuing to expand our international footprint
A forward-thinking talent strategy
All of this is driving how we continue to grow the business.
As you can see, we are intentional with everything we do.

Lines of Business
Dun & Bradstreet has four lines of business: Finance & Risk Solutions, Sales & Marketing Solutions, Government and International.

extract information and meaning from these media.
c. Create networks that curate (and/or generate) media (text today, everything else
tomorrow). Understand the problems that go into building these networks and innovate
solutions to mitigate these problems.
d. Understand patterns in time-series (and other) data, and create networks that evolve as
these patterns do, using SOTA reinforcement learning techniques, Bayesian networks,
